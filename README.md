# Multi‐Model Object Detection Ensemble

This project provides training, testing, and ensemble inference scripts for three popular object detection approaches:

- **YOLOv5** (Ultralytics)
- **YOLOv8** (Ultralytics)
- **Faster R-CNN** (torchvision)

A final `Complete.py` script runs all three detectors on a selected image, ensembles their outputs via NMS, and visualizes results with color‐coded boxes.
